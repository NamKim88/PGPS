# Coupling Policy Gradient with Population-based Search (PGPS)
In the proposed algorithm called Coupling Policy Gradient with Population-based Search (PGPS),a single TD3 agent, 
which learns by a gradient from all experiences generated by population, leads a population by providing its critic function Q as a surrogate
to select better performing next generation population from candidates. 
On the other hand, if the TD3 agent falls behind the CEM population, 
then the TD3 agent is updated toward the elite member of CEM population using loss function augmented with the distance 
between the TD3 and the CEM elite.
